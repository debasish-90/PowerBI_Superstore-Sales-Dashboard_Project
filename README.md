# PowerBI_Superstore-Sales-Dashboard_Project

I recently designed and developed a hashtag#SuperStoreSalesDashboard in hashtag#PowerBI with an integrated 15-day sales forecasting model to support short-term business planning and data-driven decisions.

The dashboard delivers a comprehensive view of sales performance across regions, segments, categories, and shipping modes while highlighting key KPIs such as Total Sales, Orders, Profit, and Average Ship Days. Interactive slicers and intuitive visuals enable quick exploration of trends and patterns for effective analysis.

Key Features :
Dynamic KPIs for Sales, Orders, Profit, and Delivery metrics.
Sales & Profit trends by Month and Region.
Performance breakdown by Category, Sub-category, Segment, and Ship Mode.
Geo-map visualization for state-wise performance insights.
15-Day Sales Forecast to assist in short-term planning and inventory decisions.
Clean, user-friendly layout for fast business understanding.
